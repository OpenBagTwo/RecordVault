## What Does This Mod Do?

This mod allows you to store music discs in chiseled bookshelves. That's it. Placing
and removing music discs works identically to how you would place and remove enchanted
books.

### Planned Features
- Visually indicate when a bookshelf slot contains a music disc
  - If it used the disc's texture, that would be gravy
- Add dedicated record shelves that can store more than six discs

## See Also

This mod is 100% compatible with [Fox Nap](https://github.com/OpenBagTwo/FoxNap),
my other mod that allows you to add your own custom music discs to the game and obtain them
in survival.
